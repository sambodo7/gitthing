to start run npm install
then run npm start
1st thing get express up and running with a page
2nd get it up on git so others can work on it
3rd get a simple test returning a 200

stopped at step 3 was looking at zombie

after this I would try to add handlebars or hogan get proper web pages returning
then split the page out between a list container then and pageination container

then I would add npm request to make request to the api

then look at adding some local storage

while writing tests as I go
